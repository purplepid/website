  Purpleids Website
</h1>

## Information

This is a project intended to promote Purpleid and let the world know who we are and what we do. It is a simple static website but important nonetheless. 

This website also serves as a training ground for me (Bruno) as the current developer working on this and any other developer who might continue working on this website in my stead.
